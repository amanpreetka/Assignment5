    <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>A Privacy Policy is a legal statement that specifies what the business owner does with the personal data
        collected from users, along with how the data is processed and for what purposes.
        In 1968, Council of Europe did studies on the threat of the Internet expansion as they were concerned with the
        effects of technology on human rights. This lead to the development of policies that were to be developed to
        protect personal data.
        This marks the start of what we know now as a "Privacy Policy." While the name "Privacy Policy" refers to the
        legal agreement, the concept of privacy and protecting user data is closely related.
    </p>


    <h3>Legal</h3>
    <p>Legal policy consists of principles the judges consider the law must uphold, such as: that law should serve the
        public interest, that it should be fair and just, etc. Different elements of legal policy, for example the
        safeguarding of personal liberty and the need for state security, may conflict.
    </p>
    <h3>Specific instruction</h3>
    <p>
        An employee code of conduct is a set of principles characterizes how an organization's workers should follow up
        on an everyday premise. It mirrors the association's day by day tasks, beliefs and organization culture. Thus,
        every set of accepted rules is one of a kind to the association it speaks to.
